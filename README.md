Pre-req
1/ Install Node.js and npm
https://nodejs.org/en/

As of OCt 2018, it installed for me:  
    •    Node.js v8.12.0 to /usr/local/bin/node  
    •    npm v6.4.1 to /usr/local/bin/npm

2/ Install Angular CLI  
$ sudo npm install -g @angular/cli

3/ Create new Angular project
$ ng new <projectname>

This will create a folder


To run the application, do:
$ cd <projectname>  
$ ng serve
** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **

In a browser, type:  
http://localhost:4200
and you will see the app being served
